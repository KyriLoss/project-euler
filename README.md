My solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) series of mathematical / computer programming problems.

For educational and demonstration purposes only. All possible similarities to solutions published by others are strictly coincidental.

## Project Euler
Based on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler): Named after Leonhard Euler and created in 2001 by Colin Hughes, it is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.

Participants can track their progress through achievement levels based on the number of problems solved. A new level is reached for every 25 problems solved. Special awards exist for solving special combinations of problems.

Quote from the [project's website](https://projecteuler.net): "_Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics_."
